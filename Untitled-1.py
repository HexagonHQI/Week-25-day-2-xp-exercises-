#Exercise 1:#

print("Hello world\n" * 4)

#Exercise 2 : 

result = (99 ** 3) * 8
print(result)

#Exercise 3 : What is the output?


#5 < 3 will output False (5 is not less than 3).
#3 == 3 will output True (3 is equal to 3).
#3 == "3" will output False (different data types: integer vs string).
#"3" > 3 will result in an error (Python cannot compare a string to an integer).
#"Hello" == "hello" will output False (case-sensitive, "Hello" is not the same as "hello").

#Exercise 4 : Your computer brand

computer_brand = "YourBrandName"
print(f"I have a {computer_brand} computer.")
Replace "YourBrandName" with the actual brand of your computer.

#Exercise 5 :  

name = "YourName"
age = 25
shoe_size = 9
info = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my shoe size is {shoe_size}."
print(info)
Replace "YourName", 25, and 9 with your actual name, age, and shoe size.

#Exercise 6 : A & B

a = 10
b = 5
if a > b:
    print("Hello World")
Replace 10 and 5 with any numbers you want to compare.

#Exercise 7 : Odd or Even

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")

#Exercise 8 : Whatâ€™s your name?

user_name = input("What is your name? ")
my_name = "YourName"
if user_name == my_name:
    print("Wow, we have the same name! That's awesome!")
else:
    print("Nice to meet you, but we have different names.")
Replace "YourName" with your actual name.

#Exercise 9 : Tall enough to ride a roller coaster

height = int(input("Enter your height in cm: "))
if height > 145:
    print("You're tall enough to ride!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you need to grow a bit more to ride.")
